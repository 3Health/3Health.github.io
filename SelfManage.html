                            <p>An effort to deal with this systemic flaw to effectively treating chronic conditions, RA in particular, are self-management programs. Self-management programs are patient-centered interventions designed to encourage and support patients to be actively involved in the management of their chronic disease. These interventions are problem-focused and action-oriented and have the goal of influencing health knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours that can directly or indirectly improve health-related quality of life for chronically ill patients (Azevedo et al., 2015). The emphasis in these programs is on understanding and coping with consequences, not medical intervention use, and encouraging patient participation as management partners with physicians and other health professionals. Because they are relatively inexpensive, these programs could represent both a substantial benefit to patients and a substantial cost savings to the healthcare system.</p>
							<strong>Traditional Self-Management Programs are Not the Solution</strong>
                            <p>While showing great promise in improving the health status of chronic disease patients, there are problems that persist with current self-management programs. There are difficulties experienced with increasing patient, physician, and organization participation (Azevedo, 2015). Self-management programs not only require a significant time commitment for participants, and individuals with chronic disease also often lack the energy to physically attend sessions; these serve as barriers for many potential participants and results in significant drop out rates. Furthermore, while self-management programs are usually finite in nature, chronic diseases are significant for the remainder of an individualâ€™s life. While these programs may improve health behaviours in the short term and provide support for a limited time, it is debatable whether or not this time or support is sufficient to impart a lasting lifestyle change.</p>
